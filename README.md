# DiscordBasic

**\*\* This application is no longer being updated anymore.**

**DiscordBasic** (also known as **Discord For Stupid Phones** ("DFSP")) is a small applications that uses the official Discord API to get and send information for very low-end devices.

It was made in PHP programming language and doesn't use any JavaScript or CSS, so it's usable on EVERY devices that has Internet connection, even on a **keypad phone** (such as mine).

I made it just for fun and for meeting my needs when I only have a computer and a keypad phone, and I want to use Discord on my keypad phone as well.
